## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
 In this Project by Frntend Mentor in building a QR code, i just learnd a few things like how to box-sizing in css, how to webkit-text-size- adjust and how to commit my project to my resopsitorry in github.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
*::before,
*::after{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
```js
const  protocol=wimdow.location.protocol;
    console.log(protocol)
}
```


### Continued development

Some Css elements are stil giving me some hard time. Taking some further courses in Css will enable me to gain more Knowledge in it and also further in UI UX Designs and deeper in JavaScript. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/7CqcKXINGds) - This helped me for how to site live with Github. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
